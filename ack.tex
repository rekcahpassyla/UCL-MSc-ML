\section*{Acknowledgements}

Special thanks are owed to the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Professor Bradley Love, for the opportunity to work with the Love Lab.
    \item Dr. Brett Roads, for much help and guidance plus access to \texttt{love17} and lots of computing power. 
    \item Professor Justine Cassell, who taught me how to write my first dissertation, without which writing this one would have been much harder. 
    \item Dr J. Jason Ward and Dr. Paul Voutier for their help with reading initial drafts.
    \item Dr. Chong Siew Meng (1950-2019), the opposition was thumped.
\end{itemize}

Only that specific directory is my code; the rest of the repository is a pre-existing library which I extended.
