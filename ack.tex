\section*{Acknowledgements}

Special thanks are due to the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Professor Bradley Love, for the opportunity to work with the Love Lab.
    \item Dr. Brett Roads, for much help and guidance and access to \texttt{love17} and lots of computing power. 
    \item Professor Justine Cassell, for the opportunity to work in the Media Lab for my first dissertation, without which writing this one would have been much harder. 
    \item Dr J. Jason Ward and Dr Paul Voutier for their help and feedback in reading initial drafts.
    \item Dr. Chong Siew Meng (1950-2019) without whose influence I would not be such a massive geek.
